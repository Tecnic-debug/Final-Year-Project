# Final-Year-Project
Technological Requirements
Sklearn - it is very useful for pre-processing data, feature extraction, and post-classification analysis.
Pyplot - makes it easy to generate plots and charts with a simple interface, which can be used extensively for visualizing data distributions
Numpy - for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
Tensorflow- used to construct deep learning models such as CNNs that analyze knee X-ray images to detect and grade the severity of osteoarthritis.
Keras - high-level neural networks API, running on top of tensorflow Keras simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models
Matplotlib - used for plotting the results of model evaluations, such as loss and accuracy curves over training epochs
Streamlit - python framework used to as a web app 
Conda -  package manager used to run streamlit
